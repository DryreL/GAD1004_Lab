# Game Development Lecture Process (2019) - Bahçeşehir University

## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of the **Game Development Lecture Series** conducted at **Bahçeşehir University** in 2019. The lecture code is GAD1004. The series introduces fundamental and advanced concepts of game development, with practical examples and hands-on sessions. The lecture process is designed for students to gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for game development.

Each project presented during the semester covers different aspects of game development, ranging from asset manipulation to creating fully functioning games from scratch. The following sections summarize the key topics and provide links to the preview videos for each project.

All these projects were previously made in Unity 2019 version. Now it has been updated to **Unity 6 LTS** version for easier access. Deprecated codes have been updated to new and it has been made easier to open the project without errors.

## Course Overview

The course covers six different projects that focus on various aspects of game development:

1. **Ready-made 2D Game**: In this project, students learn how to use a pre-existing game project and modify it by making two specific changes to demonstrate understanding of asset manipulation and customization.

2. **Screensaver**: This project focuses on creating a simple screensaver using basic animation techniques. Students build it entirely from scratch, applying their knowledge of loops and animation.

3. **Cube Spawner**: Students develop a 3D environment where cubes are spawned at regular intervals. The project demonstrates core principles of object instantiation and scene management in a 3D space.

4. **Pong Game**: A classic Pong game is developed in this project, giving students experience in game physics, input management, and basic 2D game mechanics.

5. **Maze Game**: This project adds a sense of atmosphere and challenge with a 3D maze where players navigate using a flashlight, highlighting lighting techniques and level design.

6. **Ready-made 3D Game**: Students dive deeper into character animations by using a ready-made game asset, retargeting character animations, and making additional modifications to personalize the project.

## Installation & Setup

To explore the projects in this course:

1. Install **Unity 6 LTS** or later.
2. Download the project files.
3. Open the project using the Unity.
4. Run the project in the editor to explore the code and features covered in the lecture.

## Usage

The lecture videos and projects are for educational purposes. Feel free to explore the provided content and modify the projects to enhance your learning experience.

### Example:

After setting up the environment, open the Unity project for the **Cube Spawner** lecture and experiment with adjusting the spawn intervals or adding new objects to further your understanding of 3D object manipulation.

## Features

- Six distinct game development projects showcasing different skills and techniques.
- Weekly lecture videos with practical demonstrations.
- Real-world projects for students to practice game development concepts.

## Dependencies

- **Unity 6 LTS**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the projects or viewing the videos, consider the following:

1. **Project Fails to Open**: Ensure you have the correct version of the game development software (Unity 6 LTS).
